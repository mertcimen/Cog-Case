How to Open and Use the Level Editor

The Level Editor window can be opened from the Game scene toolbar by selecting Level Editor → Grid Level Editor.

After opening the editor window:

If you want to create a new level, click the Create New Asset button.

This will create a new ScriptableObject. You will be prompted to select the folder where the asset will be saved.

Once created, enter the desired Grid Size (X and Y values).

After setting the grid size, an empty grid preview will be generated automatically.

Edit Mode

Under the Edit Mode section, you can select what you want to modify on the grid:

Wall Paint – Place or remove walls

Ball Place – Place the ball

Coin Place – Place or remove coins

While placing walls, you can hold down the mouse button to continuously paint or erase walls quickly.

After designing the level, you can press the Check Winnable (Paint All) button to simulate whether the level is completable or not.

Important:
If the newly created level data has not been assigned before, it must be manually added to the LevelContainer ScriptableObject.
This step is not required for previously existing level data.

Gameplay Note

The core gameplay mechanic is a replica of the reference game provided in the assignment.

Visual & Shader Usage

To ensure the grid area and environment appear visually as a single unified object, I utilized a feature of the Toony Colors Pro Shader, which helps achieve a stylized and cohesive visual look.

Time Spent on the Project

Approximately 12–15 hours were spent on this project.
